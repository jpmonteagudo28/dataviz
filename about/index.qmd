::: {#hero-heading}
<div class="h1"> Hello there,</div>

Thanks for stopping by!

I'm an aspiring epidemiologist currently pursuing post-graduate studies in [Epidemiology](https://www.liberty.edu/residential/health-sciences/masters/public-health/epidemiology/) at [Liberty University](https://www.liberty.edu/residential/). I'm interested in clinical epidemiology, epidemiological research methods, infectious diseases, pharmaco-epidemiology and nutritional epidemiology.

I love statistics and the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). I'm currently taking a deep dive into generalized linear models, causal inference and data visualization.

Nowadays, I work as a Learning & Development Specialist conducting a pilot study analyzing the impact of new hire training on performance in a fast-paced contact center environment.
